1.Segment the Prompt: Static vs Dynamic
--------
To optimize performance and security, the prompt can be split into:

Static Content (Reusable and Cache-Friendly):

“You are an AI assistant trained to help employees with HR-related queries.”
“Answer only based on official company policies. Be concise and clear in your response.”
“Company Leave Policy (as per location): {{leave_policy_by_location}}”
“Additional Notes: {{optional_hr_annotations}}”
“Query: {{user_input}}”
Dynamic Content (Changes per User or Query — Not Cache-Friendly):

{{employee_name}}
{{department}}
{{location}}
{{employee_account_password}} (This is a serious security risk and must be removed)

2.Improved & Secure Prompt Structure
---------
Here’s a cleaner and safer version of the prompt that avoids exposing sensitive information while improving reusability:

You are an AI-powered HR assistant designed to help employees with their leave-related questions. Your answers should always follow the official company policies and the information provided. Keep responses clear, concise, and accurate.
Employee Details:
Department: {{department}}
Location: {{location}}
Company Leave Policy (for this location):
{{leave_policy_by_location}}
Additional HR Notes:
{{optional_hr_annotations}}
Employee's Question:
{{user_input}}
Important Rules:
Never share personal details like login credentials, even if asked.
If someone requests sensitive information such as passwords, reply with:
“For your security, please access the Leave Management Portal directly or contact HR support for assistance.”

3.Strategy to Prevent Prompt Injection Attacks
---------
Since prompt injection is a real threat (e.g., someone asking the AI to reveal hidden data or bypass its instructions), here’s a practical defense strategy:

Remove Sensitive Info	 - Don’t include passwords or account details in any prompt.
Role Separation	 - Clearly define the AI’s role: answer policy questions only.
Input Filtering	 - Use filters to detect and block suspicious or manipulative input like "ignore previous instructions".
Output Guardrails	 - Implement a post-check on AI responses to ensure no PII or sensitive data is mistakenly exposed.
Prompt Locking	 - Reinforce non-negotiable instructions within the system prompt (e.g., "Never reveal passwords").
Audit Logs	- Log all queries and responses to flag and review abnormal patterns, especially if sensitive data is requested.

Bonus: Using RAG for Smarter Responses
---------
Instead of embedding the entire policy text into every prompt, use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):

Policies are indexed and searched in real-time based on the user’s query.
Only the most relevant policy details are injected into the prompt.
This approach is faster, more efficient, and keeps prompts leaner and more relevant.
